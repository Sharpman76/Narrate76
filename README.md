_Disclaimer: I’m a mechanical engineering major, not a programmer, so neither the code nor this repo is likely to be designed in the best way, so fair warning. Be thankful I even know the difference between Java and Javascript lol_

Narrate76 is a Java program that takes in a raw script for the dialogue/narration of a Minecraft map and generates a datapack and resource pack to display subtitles and play sound files for each line of dialogue at the mapmaker’s command. The program is intended for use in an adventure-map-style scenario where the lines of dialogue are in a fixed order and only get displayed/voiced one time each per playthrough.
