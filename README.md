# Narrate76

_Disclaimer: I’m a mechanical engineering major, not a programmer, so neither the code nor this repo is likely to be designed in the best way, so fair warning. Be thankful I even know the difference between Java and Javascript lol_

Narrate76 is a Java program that takes in a raw script for the dialogue/narration of a Minecraft map and generates a datapack and resource pack to display subtitles and play sound files for each line of dialogue at the mapmaker’s command. The program is intended for use in an adventure-map-style scenario where the lines of dialogue are in a fixed order and only get displayed/voiced one time each per playthrough.

If you want to borrow the code and make modifications to suit your own purposes, feel free, but it would be nice if you could credit me if you include Narrate76-derived dialogue in any projects.
